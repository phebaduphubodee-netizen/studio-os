## ลำดับอำนาจ / Authority order

กฎหมายชนะเสมอ / Thai law wins: this file carries **no statutory values**. Any
dimensional, ventilation, or daylight-opening requirement comes from
`knowledge/codes-th/mr55-residential-dimensions.md` and
`knowledge/codes-th/mr39-fire-sanitation-ventilation.md`, which outrank
everything here. (Notebook turns 8–10 could NOT ground Thai regulations —
never cite this file for law.)

## 1. ชนิดความกลมกลืนของสี / Color harmony types (วงจรสี, Albers)

Six primary harmony types for organizing an interior palette
(notebook a5a43395 turn 6, single unmapped marker [1]; the ask was scoped to
the COLOR THEORY PDF `f6354b19-6bf` + Albers *Interaction of Color*
`28fa10cb-2bd` — a wheel-based harmony taxonomy is consistent with the COLOR
THEORY source; do not attribute this list to Albers specifically):

| Harmony type | โครงสี |
|---|---|
| Complementary | สีคู่ตรงข้าม |
| Split-complementary | สีตรงข้ามแบบแยก |
| Double complementary (Tetrad) | สีตรงข้ามคู่ (สี่สี) |
| Analogous | สีข้างเคียงในวงจรสี |
| Triadic | สามสีระยะห่างเท่ากัน |
| Monochromatic | สีเดียวหลายน้ำหนัก |

## 2. กฎ 60/30/10 การกระจายสีในห้อง / 60-30-10 color distribution rule

"Golden ratio" of spatial color distribution (notebook a5a43395 turn 6):

| สัดส่วน / Share | Role | ตัวอย่างพื้นผิว / Typical carriers |
|---|---|---|
| 60% | Dominant color สีหลัก | walls, large rugs / ผนัง พรมผืนใหญ่ |
| 30% | Secondary color สีรอง | furniture, window treatments / เฟอร์นิเจอร์ ผ้าม่าน |
| 10% | Accent color สีเน้น | artwork, small accessories / งานศิลปะ ของตกแต่งชิ้นเล็ก |

> Corroboration (NOT independent verification): a second REFERENCE-tier DR
> report carries the rule with identical carriers — "sixty percent of a room
> operates as the dominant color (walls, large rugs), thirty percent as the
> secondary color (furniture, window treatments), and ten percent as the accent
> color (accessories, artwork)"; values unchanged
> (`knowledge/_inbox/id-project-corpus/Interior Design Knowledge Structuring.pdf`
> p.3, staged 2026-07-03). Source-independence is NOT established: both carriers

> blog; not held in-repo). Treat as a second REFERENCE-tier witness, not as
> confirmation from an authority.
>
> Oversized-treatment exception: when a floor-to-ceiling curtain is too large
> for the 30 % role, see **§12** — Albers' ground-subtraction lets it join the
> 60 % ground instead of displacing another secondary element.

### 2.1 กฎเลขคี่ / Odd Rule (การจัดกลุ่มของตกแต่ง / object groupings)

> PROVENANCE (this subsection + the corroboration note above only): distilled

> p.3 (DR report, REFERENCE tier, staged 2026-07-03) — separate from this file's
> NLM provenance block at the top.

- Grouping objects in **odd numbers** creates visual asymmetry, forcing the
  eye to move across the composition and generating rhythm / จัดของตกแต่ง
  เป็นกลุ่ม**จำนวนคี่** เกิดความไม่สมมาตรตามธรรมชาติ สายตาเคลื่อนผ่าน
  องค์ประกอบ เกิดจังหวะ (Interior Design Knowledge Structuring.pdf p.3).
- Machine-checkable: **odd-count validation on decorative arrays** (styling
  slots) — the source describes JSON-schema furniture layouts whose decorative
  arrays must populate with odd-numbered entity counts
  (Interior Design Knowledge Structuring.pdf p.3).
- GAP: single-source; corpus gives no group-size bounds (3 / 5 / 7?), no
  exception rules for deliberately symmetrical or formal/classical styling
  (even pairs), and no per-slot applicability list — re-source before
  promoting odd-count from advisory check to hard QA gate.

## 3. สีข้างเคียงและ simultaneous contrast / Adjacency & perceived color shift

Source: Albers *Interaction of Color* (manifest `28fa10cb-2bd`); notebook a5a43395 turn 6.

- Color is the most **relative** medium: one color reads as two different
  colors depending on its background / สีเดียวกันดูต่างกันตามพื้นหลัง.
- Simultaneous contrast (after-image effect): a ground color "subtracts" its
  own hue and lightness from any object placed on it.
- Practical consequence: a fabric or paint swatch visually shifts the moment
  it sits next to a new adjacent room color — re-judge every pairing in place.

## 4. การทดสอบสีในบริบทจริง / Testing colors in context (colored-paper method)

Source: Albers *Interaction of Color* (manifest `28fa10cb-2bd`); notebook a5a43395 turn 6.

- Perception changes with **quantity, area size, and lighting** — harmonious
  swatches fail when tested in isolation / ทดสอบสีแยกเดี่ยวไม่ได้.
- Albers method: test colors in physical proximity with **colored paper, not
  paint** — exact, unvarying comparison without brushstroke texture.
- Boundary effect / ขอบสี: **soft boundary** (torn paper, draped fabric)
  connects colors; **hard boundary** (cut paper, sharp architectural edges)
  separates them.

## 5. มุมกล้อง เลนส์ และเปอร์สเปคทีฟ / Camera viewpoint, lens & perspective (render/photo)

Sources: Ansel Adams *The Camera* (manifest `fd4ce41c-b78`), Shulman
*Photographing Architecture and Interiors* (manifest `52d018cd-a1c`);
notebook a5a43395 turns 6, 7, 14.

| Rule | ค่า / Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Viewpoint / ระดับสายตา | eye-level | natural perspective for interiors (turn 6) |
| Lens for environmental context | 28 mm or 35 mm prime | broad context, minimal edge distortion (turn 6) |
| Lens for natural human perspective | 35–50 mm | staging checklist (turn 14); wider angles only with strict compositional rules (rule of thirds / symmetry) |
| Shallow depth of field for detail shots | f/2.8 | isolates subject, physical bokeh; never arbitrary non-physical blur (turn 7) |
| Perspective control | camera-to-subject distance only | Adams: moving closer enlarges foreground vs background, changes perceived scale (turn 6) |
| Verticals / เส้นดิ่งขนาน | camera back perfectly vertical | prevents converging verticals (walls leaning); in AI render prompts enforce with "tilt-shift" modifier (turn 6) |
| One-point perspective (head-on) | camera back parallel to subject's horizontal AND vertical lines | absolute geometric accuracy (turn 6) |
| Two-point perspective | keep rules strict | essential for spatial coherence in interior rendering (turn 6) |

## 6. ฉากหน้าและโครงสร้างภาพ / Foreground layering & visual structure (Block, Shulman)

Sources: Bruce Block *The Visual Story* 3rd ed (manifest `b3e4e53d-c93`),
Shulman sources; notebook a5a43395 turns 6, 14.

- **Foreground layering / วางวัตถุฉากหน้า:** place an object (plant, chair
  edge, tabletop) in the immediate foreground — creates spatial hierarchy,
  depth, and a realistic scale anchor; head-on empty frames read flat and
  institutional.
- **Block's visual components:** deliberately organize space, line, shape,
  tone, color to structure the frame.
- **Shulman balance:** balance artificial interior lighting with natural
  daylight to show architectural volumes and realistic spatial transitions.
- **Shadow strategy:** high-contrast chiaroscuro or soft ambient occlusion
  forces realistic shadow behavior and establishes 3D geometry.
- **Merger audit / ตรวจเส้นซ้อน:** from the exact camera position, check that
  foreground and background lines do not intersect confusingly; shift camera
  to separate conflicting shapes (turn 14).

## 7. การผสมอุณหภูมิสีข้ามโซนแสง / Mixing color temperature (CCT) across lighting zones

Source: notebook a5a43395 turn 12. (Statutory or IES illuminance values are
NOT in this file — the notebook could not ground residential lux/CRI tables.)

| Zone / บริบท | CCT |
|---|---|
| Residential atmosphere / บ้านพักอาศัย (บรรยากาศอบอุ่น) | 2200–3000 K (warm) |
| Commercial environments / เชิงพาณิชย์ | 4000–5700 K (cool) |

- Rule: CCT must stay **logically consistent within a localized zone** —
  never mix a clinical 4000 K daylight source directly against a warm
  2700 K residential incandescent source in the same zone
  (ห้ามผสมแสงขาว 4000 K กับแสงวอร์ม 2700 K ในโซนเดียวกัน).

## 8. การจัดผ้าบนเตียง / Bed textile layering (styling ผ้าปูเตียง หมอน ผ้าห่ม)

Source: notebook a5a43395 turn 13 — **grounded portions only**.

Grounded (material representation for lived-in look):

- Specify weave + tactile quality explicitly so render engines compute light
  interaction (specularity, subsurface scattering) correctly — e.g.
  **"stonewashed linen, crushed velvet, bouclé, handwoven rattan"**.
- Capturing the **heavy drape of linen** is critical to convincing the eye of
  authenticity / น้ำหนักการทิ้งตัวของผ้าลินิน.
- Add micro-imperfections such as **fabric pilling** so textiles read used,
  not synthetic-smooth.

NOT grounded — dropped (notebook flagged these as outside its sources; do not
cite from here): physical layering techniques — texture mixing across layers,
asymmetrical throw draping, relaxed/non-"karate-chopped" pillows, folding the
duvet back to expose layers. Re-source before use.

## 9. เช็คลิสต์จัดฉากก่อนถ่ายภาพ/เรนเดอร์ / Staging checklist before photography (stylist checklist)

Source: notebook a5a43395 turn 14 (fully grounded, markers [1]–[14]).
Closes the vault's staging/textile gap found in the A/B benchmark.

**A. Camera & geometry / กล้องและเรขาคณิต (Adams, Shulman)**
1. Camera back parallel to walls — verticals stay parallel, architecture reads stable.
2. Audit the frame for mergers; shift camera slightly to separate conflicting shapes, remove intruding elements.
3. Anchor with a foreground object (plant, table edge, chair) for scale and depth.
4. Lens 35–50 mm at eye level; wider only with strict compositional discipline (rule of thirds, symmetrical framing).

**B. Lighting & atmosphere / แสงและบรรยากาศ (Shulman, Birn)**
5. Balance natural daylight with artificial interior light to show architectural volumes.
6. Never a single uniform source — stage three layers: ambient (fill), task (table lamps), accent (features/artwork).
7. Harmonize CCT: no 4000 K daylight clashing with 2700 K incandescent in one zone (see §7).
8. Dictate temporal mood: "golden hour" (warm dramatic shadows) or "blue hour" (warm interior vs cool exterior sky).

**C. Material & textile styling / วัสดุและผ้า**
9. Maximize tactile vocabulary: stonewashed linen, crushed velvet, bouclé, handwoven rattan, honed marble, brushed brass.
10. Introduce human imperfection — "sense of humanity" without a figure: fabric pilling, casual draping, mixed stone chips in terrazzo.
11. Material physics must behave naturally: matte (raw concrete, linen) absorbs light; polished (glass, brass) positioned to catch crisp specular highlights and reflections. Supporting value (turn 7): perfectly smooth (roughness 0.0) or perfectly matte (roughness 1.0) surfaces virtually never exist.

## 10. ช่องว่างข้อมูล / Gaps — what the notebook could NOT answer

- No residential illuminance (lux) or CRI tables per room — turn 2 excerpts
  named IES tables but contained no values; CCT ranges above are all it gave.
- No physical bed-layering technique was grounded (turn 13) — dropped, see §8.
- The notebook gave no numeric camera height (only "eye-level") and no
  TV-viewing-distance data. Both are answered elsewhere in the vault — use those,
  not this file (anchored by section + value, deliberately not by line number):
  camera height → `knowledge/rendering/render-defaults.md` **§3 — Camera &
  composition** (general **1.35–1.65 m**) and that section's **"Studio deviations"**
  block (studio, gate-proven **~1.15 m** eye camera, which outranks the general
  value); TV viewing distance →
  `knowledge/ergonomics/tv-viewing-and-furniture-dimensions.md`
  **§TV / flat-screen viewing (SMPTE, THX)** — viewing distance = diagonal
  **× 1.6** (SMPTE 30°) / **× 1.4** (THX 36°) / **× 1.2** (THX 40°), and that
  section's **1.5–3.0 m** comfort band. Scope: the gaps listed in this section are
  the NOTEBOOK's, not the vault's.
- No Thai statutory values anywhere in the notebook (turns 8–10 answered from
  model memory, explicitly flagged ungrounded) — use `knowledge/codes-th/`.
- No paint-system values (LRV, NCS/Munsell notation) in the color sources.

### 11.1 Hue → mood (palette language)

| Hue family | Effect (as stated by the source) | Design consequence given |
|---|---|---|
| Warm — red / orange / yellow | stimulate | red **raises appetite → dining rooms** |
| Cool — blue / green | calm / focus | — |
| Neutral — white | airy | supporting role |
| Neutral — brown | grounding | supporting role |
| Neutral — black | drama | supporting role |
| Neutral — gray | balance | supporting role |

- Light **value** governs perceived spaciousness: **light = airy,
  dark = intimate** (`INTERIOR-DESIGN-KB.md`:129).
- The source gives no mechanism, no magnitudes, and no exceptions for any of the
  above — it is an associative list. Do not manufacture a rationale for it, and
  do not turn "red → dining" into a rule that a dining palette must be red.

### 11.2 Light × colour interaction (the one operational rule here)

From `INTERIOR-DESIGN-KB.md`:130, verbatim in substance:

- **Warm light** enriches reds / oranges **but dulls blues**, and **can make skin
  sallow**.
- **Cool light** pops blues / greens.
- **Brightness sets saturation.**
- → **Rule: never judge a finish colour independent of its light source.**

**Pipeline consequence (studio application — an inference from the two rules
above, NOT a statement in the source):** a palette is only meaningful together
with the CCT of the zone it sits in. §7 of this file records residential zones at
**2200–3000 K (warm)** (REFERENCE tier, notebook a5a43395 turn 12); §11.2 says warm
light *dulls* blues — and the source never defines "dull". **If** that means
desaturation, a blue/green scheme specified for a warm residential zone **may** read
less saturated in the render than it does on the swatch — so re-judge it under the
zone's actual CCT before sign-off. This is the same failure §3 (simultaneous
contrast) and §4 (Albers' colored-paper test: perception changes with "quantity,
area size, and lighting") describe for adjacency — light is the third context that
moves a colour.
Second, non-reconciled witness: the same staged KB gives a **different** warm band —
"**2700–3000K** warm (living/bed/dining = cozy)" (`INTERIOR-DESIGN-KB.md`:105).
Neither band is gate-proven; do not treat either as fixed.

**Not carried:** **§7 of the KB** — the section distilled here — gives no LRV, no
NCS/Munsell notation, no CRI/TM-30 figure and no per-hue Kelvin recommendation (it
is the associative list above plus the light×colour bullet). Lighting-quality
metrics and surface reflectances are subject matter for `knowledge/lighting/` and
`knowledge/materials/`, not for this file; §7 above holds the only CCT values this
file carries.

## 12. เมื่อผ้าม่านใหญ่จนล้นบทบาท 30% / When a window treatment outgrows its 30 % role (Albers ground-subtraction)

§2 assigns window treatments to the **30 % secondary** — but the sources
contain **no rule** for the case where a floor-to-ceiling treatment is so
large it would displace another 30 % element, and **no rule** for choosing a
textile value relative to the wall it hangs against. Both refusals are
recorded in the unit; the refusal is the useful half — do not cite this file
as if the 60-30-10 literature resolved the conflict. What Albers grounds
instead:

- น้ำหนักสายตาของสีถูกกำหนดโดยปริมาณพื้นที่ / a colour's visual weight is set
  by its **"extension in area"**; increasing the quantity of a colour
  "visually reduces distance" — the mass advances, producing "nearness".
- **The lever / คานงัด:** *"any ground subtracts its own hue from colors which
  it carries"*, and *"the light of a ground subtracts in the same way that its
  hue does"* — so a light-valued textile hung against a light-valued ground
  has the visual diversion between them **"reduced if not obliterated
  visually"**.
- Consequence: ผ้าม่านผืนใหญ่ไม่จำเป็นต้องนับเป็นสีรอง 30 % — **it can be
  assigned to the 60 % ground** by choosing its value at (near) the wall's
  value, leaving the 30 % free for the element the scheme actually wants
  there.
- A complete boundary-vanish requires exact **"equal light intensity"** — the
  sources call this rare and difficult, and for fabric it is deliberately NOT
  the goal: keep a hair of value difference so the textile still reads as
  fabric, with separation carried by texture and the fold's self-shading.
  (That last move is a **studio inference** recorded in the unit's decision
  rationale, not an Albers statement.)

**Fold geometry: refused in full.** The notebook answered verbatim that none
of it is covered (fullness ratio, carrier spacing, wave depth, hem height,
track-to-glass offset) — every such number is **CONVENTION tier**, never
citable as grounded. The vault-held hard numbers are the stack/pocket depths
in `knowledge/ergonomics/casework-fixture-clearances-th-practice.md`
(single-layer S-fold stack **130 mm**; pocket ≥ 150 mm single-layer / ≥ 250 mm
two-layer — from the owner's NITAS TESSILE sheets). "Stack depth ≈ drawn wave
depth" is a studio inference, convention not citation.

Still GAP after this DR (do not fabricate): fullness ratio · carrier spacing ·
hem-to-floor gap · track-to-glass offset · sheer transmission values for a
BSDF · curtain drawing-symbol convention (ASA 2554 carries no curtain / track /
pelmet layer at all — `knowledge/classifications/thai-cad-layers-asa2554.md`).

## 13. ทางออกจากกับดักไม้โทนเดียว / Escaping the mono-material (mono-timber) trap (Albers, Postell)

> PROVENANCE (this section only): distilled 2026-07-21 from

> `56678948`; NLM notebook a5a43395), tier **REFERENCE**. Same Albers source

- **Quantity is not just area — "quantity = size × recurrence" (Albers).** The
  same wood on the *floor* (60 %) *and* a feature wall (30 %) is what
  manufactures a mono-timber monopoly: the material recurs, so its visual
  quantity exceeds either surface alone. **Escape move:** demote the floor's
  visual weight (a large soft rug) so the wood reads as the **30 % secondary**;
  keep metal as the **10 % accent**. This extends §2's 60-30-10 with a concrete
  de-monopoly lever.
- **Offset a light-wood field (the §12 ground-subtraction lever, applied in
  reverse):** warm-painted walls *wash the wood out* — the ground subtracts its
  own hue from the timber. Put the 60 % in **matte, cool-toned off-white
  plaster / limewash / textured linen**: low-frequency texture rests the eye
  and lets the grain read.
- **Wood vs black-framed glass = intentional separation, not a clash.** Albers'
  hard-boundary rule (§4): a black-alu frame *frames* the wood; the extreme
  tonal contrast reads as a structural statement, not bleeding.
- **Many functions → few masses.** Slats read as a calm continuous field
  ("stripes are overlooked as almost shapeless"); group N functional
  sub-elements into an **odd number of masses** (3) for a legible, un-busy wall
  (the §2.1 Odd Rule applied at wall scale).

Scope note: the unit's CONVENTION halves (slat rhythm/section, shadow-gap and
floating-joinery detailing, tropical veneer/finish behaviour) are **not**
carried here — they are outside-corpus rules-of-thumb held REFERENCE-in-unit
until verified vs AWI / supplier / Thai practice. The ergonomics half is
distilled separately at `knowledge/ergonomics/residential-clearances.md`
(dressing-wall section).
